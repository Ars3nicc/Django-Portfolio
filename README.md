# Personalized e-Portfolio Website V2

### Created in 2022 by Franz Manrique
Developed purposely for displaying and showcasing the author's profile, details, and working projects. The portfolio website is used solely for professional purposes such as **portfolios** and **job applications**. No particular frameworks and other backend features included. Just pure HTML and simple designs. Enjoy viewing! 

## What's new?
Polished and rendered using Django framework. This version of portfolio can now explicitly use Python structures such as modelling data and emerge WebSockets and GraphQL, this also renders css without glitches. For example, hovering a particular component will now reset or become too "buggy".
